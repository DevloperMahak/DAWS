## Project Overview

**DAWS** is a unified platform for software development teams that integrates multiple tools into a single dashboard. It streamlines the development workflow by combining task management, documentation, design, code assistance, and collaboration tools, reducing context-switching and increasing productivity.

---

## Problem Statement

Modern software teams face a fragmented workflow, using multiple tools simultaneously:

- **Task Management:** Jira
- **Documentation:** Confluence / Notion / Google Docs
- **Design Collaboration:** Figma
- **Presentations:** Google Slides
- **Coding Assistance:** ChatGPT / Gemini
- **Version Control & Issues:** GitHub

**Challenges faced:**

- Constant switching between tools reduces productivity.
- Manual updates across tools lead to inconsistencies.
- Difficulty tracking progress across multiple platforms.
- Slower requirement-to-delivery cycles due to fragmented workflows.

---

## Solution

DAWS solves this by providing a **centralized workspace** that integrates these tools into one unified interface. Key benefits:

- **Single Dashboard:** Access tasks, docs, designs, and AI assistance in one place.
- **Automated Sync:** Updates in one tool reflect across others automatically.
- **Collaboration:** Real-time notifications and team communication inside the platform.
- **AI Assistance:** Code suggestions, requirement analysis, and documentation help.
